# Elevator System

## Project description 
The "Elevator Management System" project is a web application designed to manage 16 elevators in a building, optimizing their operation to ensure smooth and efficient transportation of users between floors. The application consists of a frontend built with React and a backend developed in Spring Boot, all automated and managed using Gradle.

Technologies:
 - Frontend: React
 - Backend: Spring Boot
 - Build Automation: Gradle

## Features:

### Elevator Management:

 - Real-time monitoring of the status of each of the 16 elevators.
 - Displaying the current location of each elevator and its status (idle, moving, maintenance, etc.).
 - Assigning tasks to elevators based on my own, simple traffic management algorithm 

### User Panel:

 - Intuitive user interface for quickly calling an elevator.
 - Option to select the destination floor and view current assignments for each elevator.

### Usage:

Frontend and backend should be started on the separate terminal console

#### Cloning the Repository:

git clone <https://github.com/WiktorDybalski/Elevator_System.git>

#### Starting the Backend:

.\gradlew.bat build

.\gradlew.bat bootRun

#### Starting the Frontend:
